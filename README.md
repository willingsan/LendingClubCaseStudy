# Lending club case study
    The key objectives are to Study the data with Exploratory Data Analysis techniques. 
    Wherein used EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
    Presented PPT with PDF to illustrate the major parameter to brief while giving loans along thier data distributions.

## General Information
    A leading consumer finance company, which facilitates disbursal of personal loans, business loans, and loans for other purposes, via an online marketplace wants to identify “risky” loan applicants so that it can reduce disbursal of bad loans. At the same time legit applications shall not be rejected.
    Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.
    The entire study was broken down into simple steps, which were further divided into smaller sub steps. 


## Project Statement
    Analysing the factors which lead to the defauted loans which contributes major source of loss for the company


## Conclusions
    *Here summerising conlusions:
    - Loans given for longer terms are more likely to get charged off
    - Maximum loan default comes from states : NE, NV, ID, SD, AK, FL
    - Higher the public records for bankruptcies, greater is the risk of loan default.
    - Small business and House purpose loans were given at very high interest rates, which led to high percentage of default. Interest rate has huge impact on loan default.
    - Increase in Debt to Income ratio leads to higher default rate.
    - Unknown Employment Duration has max charged off loans.
